# intercookie
It is the setup for intercom with cookie tracking

Just embed the script into the HTML of the page and modify a few details inside the script and a few details on the intercom side. Then the integration is complete. 
Do this over the plugin as it is easier, more efficient (less resource intensive and more optimised) while also being more controllable and flexible. It is also a lot more future-proof as complete control over the script and cookies can be established.
